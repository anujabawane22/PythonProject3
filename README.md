Python based plant disease detection
This project aims to develop a Python-based application for detecting plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves.This project focuses on basic image processing techniques and may not achieve the same level of accuracy as a machine learning-based approach. However, it provides a valuable foundation for learning image processing concepts and exploring more advanced techniques in the future.

Project Tools and Technologies:-
Python: Programming language for image processing and application development.
OpenCV: Library for image processing tasks.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing.
SciPy: Library for scientific computing and image processing.
